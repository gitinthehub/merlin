# MERLIN

**Not That One.**

A short gothic horror-comedy browser adventure: a cursed village at the foot of a vampire’s castle, three questionable heroes, d20 checks with real stakes, two shops, and a Count who will correct you before he bites you.

Static single-page app. No build step. No network requests at runtime.

## Play

Open [`index.html`](index.html) directly in a browser (`file://`), or drop this folder on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with publish directory `.` and no build command (`netlify.toml` is already set).

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `index.html` | Shell |
| `style.css` | Gothic candlelight UI |
| `data.js` | Characters, items, shops, encounters, scene graph |
| `engine.js` | Dice, combat, economy, `localStorage` |
| `ui.js` | Typewriter, sheet, shops, combat UI |

Progress autosaves to `localStorage` under `merlin.save.v1` on every scene change, shop purchase, level-up, and combat turn. Refresh resumes mid-scene (and mid-fight). Use **New Game** to erase the save. The guest book lives in `merlin.fates.v1`; the castle-gate checkpoint in `merlin.gate.v1`; today's Daily Curse record in `merlin.daily.v1`.
